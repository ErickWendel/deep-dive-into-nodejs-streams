## FAQ
- `NODE_OPTIONS` is not a system recognized command, what to do?
    - If you are on Windows, the way to create environment variables is different. You must use the word `set` before the command.
    - Ex: ` "test": "set NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules && npx jest --runInBand",`

- I ran `npm test` but nothing happens, what to do?
    - Check your Node.js version. We are using version 17. Go to [node.js website](https://nodejs.org) and download the latest version.
